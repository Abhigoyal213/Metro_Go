- **Recent Searches**: Quick access to previously searched routes
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support with system preference detection
- **Booking System**: Secure ticket booking with OTP authentication
- **QR Code Tickets**: Digital tickets with QR codes for easy validation

### Admin Features (Restricted Access)
- **Network Management**: Add, edit, and remove stations and lines
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Easily reorder stations on metro lines
- **Interchange Detection**: Automatic detection and flagging of interchange stations
- **Bulk Import/Export**: Upload network data via CSV or JSON files
- **Version Compatibility Matrix**: View upgrade paths between network versions
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately on the passenger map

### Technical Features
- **Data-Driven Architecture**: Single source of truth from JSON configuration
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Optimal route calculation with interchange detection
- **Dynamic SVG Rendering**: Metro map generated from station coordinates
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Network changes and user sessions saved locally
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with adaptive layouts
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

## Tech Stack

## Authentication

### Regular Users
- Login required only for booking confirmation
- OTP-based authentication (demo mode)
- Session persists in localStorage

### Admin Access
- Restricted to specific credentials:
  - **Name**: Abhishek
  - **Phone**: 8107235363
- Full network management capabilities

**Note**: In demo mode, OTP is displayed in console and alert. For production, integrate with SMS gateway (Twilio, AWS SNS, etc.).

## Network Configuration

The metro network is configured in `public/mini-metro-network.json`:

```json
{
  "lines": [
    {
      "id": "red",
      "name": "Red Line",
      "color": "#E53935",
      "stations": [
        {
          "id": "station_1",
          "name": "Station Name",
          "x": 100,
          "y": 200
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
