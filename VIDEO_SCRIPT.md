## PROBLEM STATEMENT (20 seconds)

**[Show busy metro station or confused traveler image]**

"We've all been there - standing at a metro station, confused about which route to take, how many transfers we need, or how long our journey will take. Traditional metro apps are often cluttered, slow, or difficult to use on mobile devices.

Metro Go solves these problems with an intuitive interface and smart route planning."

## DEMO: PASSENGER JOURNEY PLANNING (60 seconds)

**[Navigate to Plan Journey page]**

"Let's start with the core feature - journey planning.

**[Click on 'From' field]**

As I click on the 'From' field, you'll notice a smart autocomplete dropdown showing all available stations. Let me select 'Airport Terminal' as my starting point.

**[Select Airport Terminal]**

**[Click on 'To' field]**

Now for the destination, I'll choose 'City Hospital'.

**[Select City Hospital]**

**[Click Find Route button]**

Watch what happens when I click 'Find Route'...

**[Route results appear with animation]**

Instantly, Metro Go calculates the optimal route and displays:
- Total journey time: 21 minutes
- Number of transfers: 1 interchange at South Junction
- Complete route timeline with color-coded metro lines
- Estimated fare

**[Point to the map]**

And here's the magic - the route is highlighted on the interactive map with a smooth animation showing the exact path from source to destination through the Blue Line and Purple Line."

## DEMO: MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS (40 seconds)

**[Resize browser to mobile view or switch to mobile device]**

"Now, let me show you something really cool about the mobile experience.

**[Show mobile view]**

On mobile devices, Metro Go adapts beautifully. Notice the 'Plan Your Journey' button at the top?

**[Click the toggle button]**

I can collapse the search section to get a full-screen view of the metro map - perfect for exploring the network.

**[Click toggle again to expand]**

And expand it back when I need to search for routes. This gives users maximum flexibility and screen space on smaller devices.

**[Scroll to show route results]**

The route results are fully scrollable, and the map appears below - no blocking, no confusion, just a smooth user experience."

## DEMO: INTERACTIVE MAP FEATURES (40 seconds)

**[Show map controls]**

"The interactive map is packed with features:

**[Click zoom in/out buttons]**

You can zoom in and out to see station details clearly.

**[Click and drag map]**

Pan around to explore different areas of the network.

**[Click on a station]**

When you click on any station, a detailed panel appears showing:
- Station name and lines it connects to
- Whether it's an interchange station
- Quick actions to set it as your source or destination

**[Show interchange station]**

Interchange stations are specially marked with multiple line colors, making transfers easy to identify.

**[Show legend]**

And the legend shows all metro lines with their distinctive colors - Red, Blue, Yellow, and Purple lines."

## DEMO: BOOKING FLOW (45 seconds)

**[Click 'Book This Route' button]**

"Let's complete a booking. When I click 'Book This Route'...

**[Login page appears]**

The system prompts for authentication to ensure secure bookings.

**[Enter phone number and name]**

I'll enter my phone number and name. In a real scenario, this would send an OTP to verify the user.

After entering the OTP...

**[Booking confirmation page appears]**

Voila! Here's the booking confirmation with:
- A unique booking reference number
